# Debug Marching & Leading

# Nintendo coded Debug Marching differently, 
# it doesn't transform the player into an AI and
# it checks for Marching mode in 189 different
# functions, likely patching each thing for 
# every marching player

# Debug Leading doesn't do this, it transforms the
# players into AI (to follow a point, which is the player)
# and the input action copy is just directly copying the
# controlled player's inputs to the AI's inputs

# For my reimplementation, Debug Leading is 
# the exact same as the debug build, but Marching
# is different, it does transform the player into an
# AI and copies the controlled player's inputs and
# stick to the AI. Works perfectly, I don't know why
# Nintendo didn't do this in the debug build

# For changing players to AI and changing mode, it
# only does it when iterated player is controlled player,
# because else it would happen multiple times instead of once,
# and to avoid desync with Debug Moving toggle
# Sets "dirty" bool when toggled, for Display Dirty (D) Debug Mark patch

# It loops through every player to enable/disable the AI,
# but it will never set the controlled player to an AI

# Hook location is different than Nintendo's, but works and
# behaves the same way

# Game::Player::calcControl + 0x2D60
# 0xE253DC -> BL 0x1B6169C

# X25 + 0x14 = Debug Marching/Leading modes (0 -> Disabled, 1 -> Marching, 2 -> Leading)
