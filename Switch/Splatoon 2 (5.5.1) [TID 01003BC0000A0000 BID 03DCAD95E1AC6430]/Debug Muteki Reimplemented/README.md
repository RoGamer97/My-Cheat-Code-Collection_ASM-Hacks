## IPS and PCHTXT

You can use the .ips file by creating a folder in `atmosphere/exefs_patches/` directory and placing the file inside it.

Example: `atmosphere/exefs_patches/Debug Muteki Reimplemented/*.ips file*` 

Note that the path may vary if you're using an emulator.


Alternatively, you can generate the `.ips` file yourself using **IPSwitch** by creating a folder in `switch/ipswitch/` directory, placing the `DebugMuteki5.5.1.pchtxt` file inside, and then building it with **IPSwitch**.

Example: `switch/ipswitch/Debug Moving Reimplemented (you can Fly)/DebugMuteki5.5.1.pchtxt`.


You can also copy the patch from the `.pchtxt` file and paste it into your own `.pchtxt` if you want to combine it with other patches.
