## Mii Heads on Minimap

This custom cheat code patch makes it so the mii icon appears on the minimap instead of the character icon. 

It will not affect CPUs in online play (Tournaments/Friend Room). In offline Single Player, it only affects you and the Time Trials ghost. It does not work in offline Multiplayer
