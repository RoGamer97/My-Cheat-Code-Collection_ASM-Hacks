## 1st Place Crown on Minimap

This custom cheat code patch brings back the first place crown on minimap just like Mario Kart 8 Wii U!

I made another patch called "Crown in 1st Place" that makes it so the player in 1st place has a crown on their head, on the minimap, and on their nametag, just like Battle Mode and Mario Kart World's Knockout Tour. You can find it here in the IPS Patches folder
