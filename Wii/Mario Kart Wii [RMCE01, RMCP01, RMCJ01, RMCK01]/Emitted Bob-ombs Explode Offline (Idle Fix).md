## Emitted Bob-ombs Explode Offline (Idle Fix)

This code fixes the issue where emitted Bob-ombs (dropped from Bushes/Woodboxes) stay on sitting animation, slide on slanted surfaces and never explode in offline play.

This issue is fixed on Item Rain, I decided to analyze Bean's code and found out that he fixed it inside of the main Item Rain hook code. I decided to recreate it for regular object emit.

By default, Bob-ombs have forward throw duration until explosion (5 seconds). I thought it would be cool if the user could change the duration, only for emitted Bob-ombs, so I included it in the code.

You can modify the time until explosion to your liking, or you can just use the original value.
