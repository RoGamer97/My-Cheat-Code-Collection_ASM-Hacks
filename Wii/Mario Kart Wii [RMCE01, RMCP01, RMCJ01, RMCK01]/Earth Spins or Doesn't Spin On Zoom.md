## Earth Spins/Doesn't Spin On Zoom

This code allows you to force the earth to either always spin or never spin when zoomed out. For reference, the earth spins when revealing your opponents in a Worldwide. By forcing it to always spin, it will spin when going to "Friends" page, sending a Friend Room message, revealing opponents on Regionals, Mario Kart Channel or anything that does zoom. The same applies for never spin, you can make it so it never spins when revealing opponents in a Worldwide.
