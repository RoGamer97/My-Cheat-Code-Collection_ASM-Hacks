<details>
<summary>Enable AI Rubberbanding Anywhere (Every AI)</summary>

Enables AI Rubberbanding from Highway Battle anywhere (any mode/event or Free Roam), for every AI. Forces them to always be rubberbanding.

<summary>Enable Cop AI Rubberbanding Anywhere (Only Cops)</summary>

Enables AI Rubberbanding from Highway Battle anywhere (any mode/event or Free Roam), for cops only. Forces them to always be rubberbanding. Cops are extremely crazy with this code. It's very fun!
Every other AI will behave as normal, including Chinese goons from Outrun Carmen event (They use cop AI but I added a check to exclude rubberbanding in that event). If you want every AI to rubberband, use the other code, above this one.

This code is fun when used with "Patrol Cops Always Spawn with Goal AI" which makes patrol cops (Also known as "Heat 4 Cops") rubberband. If you want the opposite, use "Patrol Cops Never Spawn with Goal AI" so patrol cops can't rubberband

<summary>Rubberbanding AI Chases & Rams You</summary>

Rubberbanding AI will chase and ram you, very crazy and fun. Recommended to use with the "Force Rubberbanding AI Speed" code so the AIs are always moving at a constant speed, else, their speed will be based
on your speed and they won't move if you don't move. 

Recommended to use with "Indestructive Cop Cars (No Damage)"

<summary>Cops Can't Rubberband in Highway Battle (Game Fix)</summary>

This code fixes an issue where cops can rubberband in Highway Battle, meaning that cops will no longer be crazy in Highway Battles. This is basically a fix that the developers should have done but forgot or they never saw cops
rubberbanding and forgot that they also use the same function as the AI racer. Rushed game, I guess they didn't test every aspect in gameplay. Do NOT use this with "Enable AI Rubberband for Player AI"!
