## About

Welcome to my collection of cheat codes (ASM hacks) for various games across multiple platforms. Here, you'll find a variety of codes, including quality of life, efficiency, crazy, fun, useful, and more - all made by me! 

Private codes are usually not included, however, over time, some are eventually released here.

### Organization

Folders are organized by platform. Inside each platform folder, you'll find:

- **Game name folder**: Starts with the game name, followed by **version** or **region**, and then the **Game ID**.
- **Codes:** All the codes for that game inside the corresponding game name folder.

Some related codes are grouped together in single files. If a file name includes ```... Codes (X Codes)```, it contains multiple related codes (where X is the number of codes in that file). Be sure to review the file carefully when searching for a specific code.

Please enjoy these codes as much as I enjoyed making them!
