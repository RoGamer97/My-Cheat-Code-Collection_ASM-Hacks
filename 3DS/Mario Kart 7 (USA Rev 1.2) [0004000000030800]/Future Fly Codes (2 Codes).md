## Future Fly Codes

Two Future Fly codes, one is the real code (Same flight from MKW version) other one is artificial (no coordinate manipulation, "native" flight, focused on Koopa Clown Kart being flyable with realistic physics)

<details>
<summary>Real Future Fly</summary>

Real Future Fly. Allows you to fly freely. You can also rotate and go up and down with the stick. Flight is exactly like MKW version. Lite version because no Up/Down/Left/Right strafe. Code only affects you

XXXXXXXX: you can Fly... (Enable code)
YYYYYYYY: Cancel (Disable code)

<summary>"Native" Future Fly (Flyable Koopa Clown/Cloud Kart)</summary>

This code allows you to fly. You can move freely in the air like a plane, go up, down, turn, forward and back. Differently from regular Future Fly, this code doesn't mess with coordinates or stuff like this, the game does the physics itself, up and down is
the gravity being replaced with the controller stick up and down, and doing a hook to make it less strong (else it would go up and down very fast) and make it go up/down stronger when accelerating - if you want it to go up and down fast, a hook 
isn't even necessary; this entire code doesn't need hooks but I did a single hook for that reason. Like some other codes included in this release, this is a remake of a code I made in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and it is exactly how it is in Deluxe, which a small
exception which is that brakes will not be stronger, but releasing accel will make you instant stop. I found brake strenght but it makes reversing slow and I couldn't bother to look for a fix.
The way physics work in MK7 doesn't make it 100% accurate to Deluxe's version but Deluxe version of the code is done the same way as this, but with few more patches for things that aren't in MK7.
The code also modifies some physics such as speed, acceleration, deacceleration, turning speed etc, as well as minimal sound and visual changes to make it accurate to Deluxe and give a feel that the kart is a flyable vehicle rather than a drivable
vehicle - thus, why the code name is Flyable Koopa Clown Kart, because if you use the Koopa Clown Kart, it looks like it's flyable by default, like other Mario games, or maybe even the Cloud Kart because it's a cloud!
Deactivator is not included and code affects everyone rather than only you - did for fun because I love making specific codes for multiple Mario Kart games, such as this and few other codes, which some are even included here. I didn't even test in
